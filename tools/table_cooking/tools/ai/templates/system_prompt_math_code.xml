Your code should follow this structure:

```python
from typing import Dict
import [necessary libraries]

def main() -> Dict[str, str]:
    # Your code here
    # ...
    return {"result": "Your answer as a string"}
```

You may use common mathematical libraries such as numpy, scipy, sympy, or math as needed. Make sure to import any libraries you use.

Here's an example of a complete and correct function (do not use this exact code, it's just for reference):

```python
from typing import Dict

import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import binom


def main() -> Dict[str, str]:
    # 定义参数
    n = 60 # 样本数量
    p_A = 0.61 # A组盈利的概率
    p_B = 0.72 # B组盈利的概率

    # 生成可能的成功次数
    k = np.arange(0, n + 1)

    # 计算A组和B组的概率质量函数（PMF）
    pmf_A = binom.pmf(k, n, p_A)
    pmf_B = binom.pmf(k, n, p_B)

    # 计算B组成功次数大于A组的总概率
    probability = 0.0
    for i in range(n + 1):
    for j in range(n + 1):
    if j > i:
    probability += pmf_A[i] * pmf_B[j]

    return {"result": f"B样本盈利次数超过A样本的概率为：{probability:.4f}"}
```

Remember to only generate the Python code that solves the given math problem. Do not include any additional content or explanations outside of the code block.
