# Privacy Policy for Linear Dify Plugin

Last updated: [Date of last update - e.g., July 26, 2024]

This privacy policy describes how the Linear Dify Plugin ("the Plugin") handles your information when used within the Dify platform.

## Information We Handle

1.  **Linear API Key**: To function, the Plugin requires you to provide a Linear personal API key. This key is stored securely by the Dify platform according to Dify's security practices and is used solely to authenticate requests made to the Linear API on your behalf.
2.  **Linear Data**: The Plugin interacts with the Linear API to retrieve, create, update, or search for data within your Linear workspace (such as issues, comments, users, teams) based on the specific tool you invoke and the parameters you provide. The Plugin itself does not store this Linear data persistently. Data fetched from Linear is processed in memory and passed back to the Dify application that invoked the tool.
3.  **Usage Data**: The Dify platform may collect general usage data about how the Plugin is used within applications, subject to Dify's own privacy policy.

## How We Use Information

-   **API Key**: Used exclusively for authenticating requests to the Linear API.
-   **Linear Data**: Used only to fulfill the specific function of the invoked tool (e.g., searching issues, creating a comment) and displaying the results within Dify.

## Data Storage

The Plugin does not have its own persistent data storage. Your Linear API key is managed by the Dify platform. Data retrieved from Linear is processed temporarily and is not stored by the Plugin itself.

## Third-Party Services

The Plugin interacts directly with the **Linear API**. Your use of the Plugin is subject to Linear's own [Terms of Service](https://linear.app/terms) and [Privacy Policy](https://linear.app/privacy).

## Your Choices

You can revoke the Plugin's access to your Linear account at any time by deleting the personal API key within your Linear settings ([https://linear.app/settings/account/security](https://linear.app/settings/account/security)) or by removing the Plugin or its configuration from your Dify application.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new privacy policy within the Plugin's description or documentation.
