# Privacy Policy - HubSpot Plugin for Dify

## Data Collection and Usage

The HubSpot plugin for Dify ("we", "our", or "the plugin") facilitates access to your HubSpot CRM data. Below is information about how we handle your data:

### What Data We Collect

- **CRM Data**: Information retrieved from your HubSpot account including but not limited to:

### How We Use Your Data

- **Authentication**: Your API token is used solely to authenticate with HubSpot's API on your behalf
- **Service Functionality**: Retrieved CRM data is only used to provide the requested functionality within your Dify applications
- **No Data Storage**: The plugin does not permanently store your CRM data outside of temporary caching for performance optimization

### Data Sharing

We do not share your data with any third parties. All data remains within the plugin's execution environment and your Dify workspace.

## Data Security
