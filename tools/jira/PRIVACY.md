## Privacy Policy

This privacy policy outlines how the Dify Jira Plugin handles your information when you use it to interact with your Jira instance.

### Data Collection

The Dify Jira Plugin requires the following information to function:

1.  **Jira Credentials:** Your Jira domain, username (or email), and API token are required to authenticate with your Jira instance. These credentials are securely stored by Dify's credential management system and are used solely for making API requests to your Jira instance on your behalf.
2.  **User Inputs:** Data you provide when using the plugin's tools, such as project keys, issue summaries, descriptions, issue IDs, JQL queries, board IDs, etc., are collected to perform the requested actions (e.g., creating an issue, searching for issues).

### Data Processing

-   **Jira Credentials:** Your credentials are used exclusively to authenticate API requests sent from the plugin to your Jira instance. They are not used for any other purpose.
-   **User Inputs:** The data you provide is used to construct API requests to Jira to perform actions like creating, deleting, retrieving, or listing issues, projects, and boards.

### Third-party Services

This plugin interacts directly with the **Atlassian Jira API**. Your use of Jira is subject to Atlassian's privacy policy and terms of service. The plugin acts as an intermediary, sending your requests and data to the Jira API and returning Jira's responses. No data is shared with any other third-party services.

### Data Retention

The Dify Jira Plugin itself does not store your Jira credentials or user input data persistently. Credentials are managed by the Dify platform. Data related to your interactions (like issue details) resides within your Jira instance and is subject to Jira's data retention policies. Logs generated by Dify during plugin execution might contain operational data but are handled according to Dify's platform policies.

### User Rights

Your rights regarding the data stored within Jira (issues, projects, etc.) are governed by your Jira instance's settings and Atlassian's policies. You can manage your data directly within Jira. For data handled by the Dify platform (like stored credentials), please refer to Dify's privacy policy and user settings.

### Contact Information

If you have any questions or concerns about the privacy practices of this plugin, please contact the plugin author.
