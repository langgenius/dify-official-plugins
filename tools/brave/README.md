## Overview

**Brave** is a privacy-focused tool powered by the BraveSearch engine, offering unbiased, independent, and fast search results through its own index. 

In **Dify** , Brave provides secure and accurate search functionality with optional JSON output, which allows structured data exchange. This is particularly useful for LLM applications, as JSON enables clear hierarchical organization of search results, making it easier for models to process, extract key information, and deliver more accurate, contextually relevant responsesâ€”all while ensuring user privacy and data security.
