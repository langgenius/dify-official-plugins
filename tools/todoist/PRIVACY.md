# Privacy Policy

## Data Collection
This plugin collects and processes the following information:
- The Todoist access token provided by the user through the plugin interface. This token is used to authenticate and interact with the Todoist API on behalf of the user.
- Tasks, projects, and other Todoist-related data entered by the user through the plugin's functionality.

We collect this data to:
- Enable the plugin to perform its core functions, such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks and projects in Todoist.
- Authenticate the user and authorize access to their Todoist account.

## Data Processing and Storage
- The Todoist access token is securely stored and used solely for authorized communication with the Todoist API.
- Data processed by the plugin (e.g., task details) is temporarily stored in memory only while performing the requested operations. We do not persistently store users' Todoist data on our servers.
- All communication with the Todoist API is encrypted via HTTPS.

## Third-Party Services
This plugin interacts directly with the Todoist API. We recommend users review Todoist's privacy policy to understand their data handling practices: [https://todoist.com/privacy](https://todoist.com/privacy)

Apart from Todoist, this plugin does not share user data with any other third-party services.

## Data Retention
We do not retain users' Todoist access tokens or any personal Todoist data longer than necessary to perform the requested operations. Once the operation is completed or the user session ends, this information is discarded.

## User Rights
Users have the following rights regarding their data:
- **Right of Access**: Users can request access to any data temporarily held about them (though, as noted above, we do not store data long-term).
- **Right to Rectification**: If users believe any data we hold is incorrect, they have the right to request corrections.
- **Right to Erasure**: Users can revoke their Todoist access token from the plugin at any time, effectively removing our ability to access their Todoist data.
- **Right to Withdraw Consent**: Users can withdraw consent for the plugin to process their data by uninstalling the plugin from their Dify instance or revoking the plugin's authorization in Todoist.

## Contact Information
If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy or your data, please contact us at [insert your contact information, such as an email address or a link to a support page].
