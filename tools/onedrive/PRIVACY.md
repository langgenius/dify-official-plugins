**Effective Date: July 31, 2025**

This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use the Microsoft OneDrive Plugin for Dify.

## Information Collection

We do not collect, store, or share any personal information from users. All data processed by the plugin is handled locally or through secure connections to Microsoft services, as required for plugin functionality.

## Use of Information

The plugin only accesses your Microsoft OneDrive data to provide the requested features, such as searching, retrieving, uploading, or deleting files and folders. No data is stored or transmitted to third parties by the plugin itself.

## Data Security

We are committed to ensuring the security of your data. All communications with Microsoft services use secure protocols (such as HTTPS). We do not retain any user credentials, file contents, or metadata beyond the duration of your session.

## Third-Party Services

This plugin interacts with Microsoft OneDrive via official APIs. Please refer to Microsoft's privacy policy for details on how your data is handled by Microsoft services.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted in this document with an updated effective date.

## Contact

If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact the developer at [hello@dify.ai](mailto:hello@dify.ai) or refer to the project repository for more information.
