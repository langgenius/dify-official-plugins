# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date: August 7, 2025**

This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use the Google Contacts Plugin for Dify.

## Information Collection

We do not collect, store, or share any personal information from users. All data processed by the plugin is handled locally or through secure connections to Google services, as required for functionality.

## Use of Information

The plugin only accesses your Google Contacts data to provide the requested features, such as viewing, creating, updating, searching, or managing contact information. No data is stored or transmitted to third parties by the plugin itself.

## Data Security

We are committed to ensuring the security of your data. All communications with Google services use secure protocols (such as HTTPS). We do not retain any user credentials or contact data beyond the duration of your session.

## Third-Party Services

This plugin interacts with Google Contacts via the official People API. Please refer to Google's privacy policy for details on how your data is handled by Google services.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted in this document with an updated effective date.

## Contact

If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact the developer [hello@dify.ai](mailto:hello@dify.ai) or refer to the project repository for more information.
