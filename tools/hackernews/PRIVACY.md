# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date: Aug 2025**

This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use the Hacker News Plugin for Dify.

## Information Collection

We do not collect, store, or share any personal information from users. This plugin accesses only publicly available data from Hacker News through their official API. No authentication or personal credentials are required.

## Use of Information

The plugin only accesses publicly available Hacker News content, including:
- Public stories and articles
- Public user profiles and submission histories
- Public comments and discussions

No personal or private information is accessed, stored, or transmitted by the plugin.

## Data Security

We are committed to ensuring the security of data access. All communications with Hacker News services use secure protocols (such as HTTPS). The plugin does not store any data locally and operates in a stateless manner.

## Third-Party Services

This plugin interacts with Hacker News via their official public API. The data accessed is the same as what is publicly viewable on the Hacker News website. Please refer to Y Combinator's privacy policy for details on how Hacker News data is handled by their services.

## No Authentication Required

Unlike many other plugins, this plugin requires no user authentication, OAuth flows, or personal credentials. It only accesses publicly available information that anyone can view on the Hacker News website.

## Data Retention

The plugin does not retain any data. All information is fetched in real-time from Hacker News and provided directly to the user without storage or caching.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted in this document with an updated effective date.

## Contact

If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact the developer [hello@dify.ai](mailto:hello@dify.ai) or refer to the project repository for more information.
