# Privacy Policy

## Google Drive Plugin Privacy Policy

This privacy policy describes how the Google Drive plugin ("we", "our", or "the plugin") collects, uses, and handles your information when you use our plugin with Dify.

### Information We Collect

The Google Drive plugin requires access to the following information:

1. **Google Service Account Credentials**: The plugin requires a Google service account JSON key file to authenticate with Google Drive API. This includes private keys and account identifiers.

2. **File and Folder Data**: When using the plugin, we access file and folder metadata (names, IDs, MIME types) and content from your Google Drive based on the operations you perform.

3. **User Queries**: Search terms and parameters you provide when using the search functionality.

### How We Use Information

The information collected is used solely for the purpose of:

1. Authenticating with Google Drive API
2. Executing the requested operations (searching, creating, or managing files and folders)
3. Returning the requested information to your Dify application

We do not:
- Store your credentials or file data outside of your Dify environment
- Use your data for any purpose other than providing the requested functionality
- Share your information with third parties

### Data Storage and Transmission

- **Credentials**: Your Google service account credentials are stored securely within your Dify environment and are only used to authenticate API requests.
- **File Data**: File content is transmitted directly between your Dify environment and Google Drive. We do not store file content after the operation is complete.
- **API Requests**: All communication with Google Drive API occurs over encrypted HTTPS connections.

### Your Responsibilities

As a user of this plugin, you are responsible for:

1. Securing your Google service account credentials
2. Ensuring your service account has appropriate permissions
3. Complying with Google's terms of service and data policies
4. Obtaining necessary consent if using the plugin to process others' data

### Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify users of any changes by updating the "last updated" date at the top of this policy.
