# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy explains how the Zoom Plugin for Dify handles your information when you use our video conferencing and meeting management tools.

## Information Collection

We do not collect, store, or retain any personal information from users. The plugin operates as a secure bridge between Dify and Zoom's official API services, processing data only as necessary to fulfill your meeting management requests.

### Data Processing

The plugin processes the following types of data temporarily and exclusively for service functionality:

- **Authentication Tokens**: OAuth access and refresh tokens for Zoom API authentication
- **Meeting Information**: Meeting topics, schedules, participant settings, and configuration options
- **User Requests**: Commands and parameters you provide for meeting operations

All data is processed in real-time and is not stored beyond the duration of your active session.

## Use of Information

The plugin accesses your Zoom data solely to provide the requested meeting management features, including:

- Creating new Zoom meetings with specified settings
- Retrieving information about existing meetings
- Listing your scheduled meetings
- Updating meeting configurations
- Deleting meetings when requested

No data is stored, analyzed, or transmitted to any third parties by the plugin itself.

## Data Security

We are committed to ensuring the security of your data through:

- **Secure Communication**: All communications with Zoom services use HTTPS encryption
- **OAuth Authentication**: Industry-standard OAuth 2.0 protocol for secure API access
- **No Persistent Storage**: No user credentials, meeting data, or personal information is retained
- **Temporary Processing**: Data is processed only during active operations and immediately discarded

## Authentication and Credentials

The plugin uses OAuth 2.0 authentication to securely connect to your Zoom account:

- **Client Credentials**: Zoom application client ID and secret (configured by administrators)
- **Access Tokens**: Temporary tokens for API access (automatically refreshed)
- **No Password Storage**: Your Zoom password is never accessed or stored

All authentication is handled directly between your browser, Zoom's servers, and the plugin runtime.

## Third-Party Services

This plugin interacts exclusively with Zoom's official API services. Your data is subject to:

- **Zoom's Privacy Policy**: Please refer to [Zoom's Privacy Policy](https://zoom.us/privacy) for details on how Zoom handles your data
- **Zoom's Security**: All meeting data and account information is managed by Zoom's secure infrastructure

## Data Retention

We do not retain any user data. Specifically:

- **No Meeting Storage**: Meeting details are not saved after operations complete
- **No User Profiles**: No user account information is maintained
- **No Usage Analytics**: No tracking or analytics data is collected
- **Session-Only**: All data processing is limited to your active session

## User Rights

Since we do not store personal data, there is no persistent data to access, modify, or delete. All operations are performed in real-time against Zoom's services using your authenticated account.

## Compliance

This plugin is designed to be compliant with:

- **GDPR**: No personal data storage or processing beyond immediate operational needs
- **CCPA**: No collection or retention of personal information
- **SOC 2**: Secure data handling practices
