# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date: July 18, 2025**

This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use the Microsoft Excel 365 Plugin for Dify.

## Information Collection

We do not collect, store, or share any personal information from users. All data processed by the plugin is handled locally or through secure connections to Microsoft Excel 365 services via Microsoft Graph API, as required for functionality.

## Use of Information

The plugin only accesses your Microsoft Excel 365 data to provide the requested features, such as reading, writing, creating, and managing Excel workbooks and worksheets. This includes file management, workbook operations, worksheet data manipulation, and search functionality. No data is stored or transmitted to third parties by the plugin itself.

## Data Security

We are committed to ensuring the security of your data. All communications with Microsoft Excel 365 services use secure protocols (such as HTTPS) through Microsoft Graph API. We do not retain any user credentials, Excel data, or workbook information beyond the duration of your session.

## Third-Party Services

This plugin interacts with Microsoft Excel 365 via Microsoft Graph API. The plugin requires OAuth2 authentication and uses the following scopes: `Files.ReadWrite` for reading and writing Excel files, and `offline_access` for maintaining access to your data. Please refer to Microsoft's privacy policy for details on how your data is handled by Microsoft Excel 365 services.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted in this document with an updated effective date.

## Contact

If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact the developer [hello@dify.ai](mailto:hello@dify.ai) or refer to the project repository for more information.
