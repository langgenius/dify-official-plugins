## Important Notes

- The plugin requires active Microsoft 365 subscription with Excel access
- Files must be stored in OneDrive or SharePoint
- Large ranges may impact performance - use specific ranges when possible
- The OAuth token auto-refreshes using the refresh token

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues
- Ensure redirect URI matches exactly in Azure app settings
- Check that all required permissions are granted
- Try re-authenticating if token expires

### Access Issues  
- Verify the user has access to the target workbooks
- Ensure files are in OneDrive/SharePoint (not local)
- Check file isn't locked by another user

### Data Format Issues
- Values must be provided as 2D arrays for write operations
- Use proper Excel A1 notation for ranges (e.g., "A1:D10")
- Worksheet names are case-sensitive
