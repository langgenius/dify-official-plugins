## Privacy Policy

The DICOM Reader plugin processes files you upload in order to extract metadata, pixel statistics, and optional preview images. All processing happens within your Dify runtime environment.

- No personal data or medical information is collected, stored, or transmitted outside of your environment by this plugin.
- Uploaded DICOM files and generated previews are used solely to fulfill the requested action and are not retained once processing completes.
- You retain full control of any resulting data; the plugin does not send information to external services.

If you have additional compliance requirements, please review how files are managed within your own hosting environment.
