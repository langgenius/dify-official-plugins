# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date: August 5, 2025**

This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use the Twitter Plugin for Dify.

## Information Collection

We do not collect, store, or share any personal information from users. All data processed by the plugin is handled locally or through secure connections to Twitter (X) services, as required for functionality.

## Use of Information

The plugin only accesses your Twitter data to provide the requested features, such as posting tweets, liking posts, retrieving user information, and deleting tweets. No data is stored or transmitted to third parties by the plugin itself.

## Data Security

We are committed to ensuring the security of your data. All communications with Twitter services use secure protocols (such as HTTPS and OAuth 2.0). We do not retain any user credentials, tweets, or personal data beyond the duration of your session.

## OAuth 2.0 Authorization

This plugin uses OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication with Twitter. During the authorization process:
- You will be redirected to Twitter's official authorization page
- We only request the minimum necessary permissions for plugin functionality
- Access tokens are handled securely and are not stored permanently
- You can revoke access at any time through your Twitter account settings

## Third-Party Services

This plugin interacts with Twitter (X) via official APIs. Please refer to Twitter's Privacy Policy at [https://twitter.com/privacy](https://twitter.com/privacy) for details on how your data is handled by Twitter services.

## Data Processing

The plugin processes the following types of data solely for functionality purposes:
- Tweet content (when posting or retrieving tweets)
- User profile information (when requested through get_user_info tool)
- Tweet interactions (likes, replies, deletions)

All data processing occurs in real-time and no personal data is permanently stored by the plugin.

## User Rights

You have the right to:
- Revoke plugin access through your Twitter account settings
- Control what data the plugin can access through Twitter's permission system
- Request information about how your data is being used

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted in this document with an updated effective date.
