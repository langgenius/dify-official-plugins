# ComfyUI

## Overview

[ComfyUI](https://www.comfy.org/) is the most powerful and modular diffusion model GUI, API and backend with a graph/nodes interface. Now you can use it in Dify, input the prompt or images, and get the generated image.

## Configuration

### 1. Ensure that the ComfyUI workflow is running normally

Please refer to its [official documentation](https://docs.comfy.org/get_started/gettingstarted) to ensure that ComfyUI can run normally and generate images.

### 2. Export the API file of the workflow

### 3. Get ComfyUI tools from Plugin Marketplace

The ComfyUI tools could be found at the Plugin Marketplace, please install it first.

### 4. Integrate ComfyUI in Dify

#### Chatflow / Workflow applications

Both Chatflow and Workflow applications support the `ComfyUI` tool node. After adding it, you need to fill in the "Input Variables â†’ Prompt" in the node with variables to reference the user's input prompt or the content generated by the previous node. Finally, use the variable to reference the image output by `ComfyUI` in the "End" node.

#### Agent applications

Add the `ComfyUI` tool in the Agent application, then send a picture description in the dialog box to call the tool to generate an AI image.

### Image input

Some ComfyUI workflows require multiple images inputs. In Dify, it will find every `LoadImage` node in the `WORKFLOW JSON` and fill in the image files input by the user in order. When you want to change this order, you can adjust it by filling in the `Image node ID list`. For example, if your workflow needs to input images into the 35th, 69th, and 87th nodes, then input `69,35,87` will pass the first image to the 69th node.

## Nodes

### workflow

workflow node is Basic node for ComfyUI.
You can set any ComfyUI node settings by inputting JSON to this node.

### Txt2Img

Txt2Img node can generate an image from texts(prompt and negative prompt).
If you want to generate large images(typically 1600x1600 or bigger), HiresFix option is for you.
It generates a small and consistent image then upscale it.
Without HiresFix, large images tend to have unnaturally duplicated objects and artifacts.

### Img2Img

Img2Img node can edit an given image according to prompt and negative prompt.

### Img2Vid

Img2Vid node can generate an video from an given image.
You need to install [SVD model](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-video-diffusion-img2vid) or [SVD XT model](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-video-diffusion-img2vid-xt) to ComfyUI in advance. [Hugging Face Download node](#hugging-face-download) would be helpful to 
download them.

### Upscale

Upscale node can enlarge an given image with models. 

### Depth Anything

Depth Anything node can perform monocular depth estimation.
You need to install https://github.com/kijai/ComfyUI-DepthAnythingV2 to ComfyUI in advance.

### Depth Pro

Depth Pro node can perform monocular depth estimation.
You need to install https://github.com/spacepxl/ComfyUI-Depth-Pro to ComfyUI in advance.

### Face Swap

Face Swap node can extract a face on the first image and infuse it to the second image.
You need to install https://github.com/Gourieff/ComfyUI-ReActor to ComfyUI in advance.

### List Models

List Models can fetch all models available on the connected ComfyUI.
Those models include checkpoints, LORAs and upscale models.

### List Samplers

List Samplers node can fetch all samplers and schedulers available on the connected ComfyUI.

### Image Info

Image Info node can extract basic information from a given image.
These include width, height, [mode](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/handbook/concepts.html#modes), filename and MIME type.
This node would be useful when you use [Img2Vid node](#img2vid).

### CivitAI Download

CivitAI Download node can download models from [CivitAI](https://civitai.com/home).
You need to input model ID and version ID to download a model.
These two IDs are shown as AIR(see the highlited area on the image below).

You need to install https://github.com/ServiceStack/comfy-asset-downloader to ComfyUI in advance.

### Hugging Face Download
Hugging Face Download can download models from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/).
You need to install https://github.com/ServiceStack/comfy-asset-downloader to ComfyUI in advance.
