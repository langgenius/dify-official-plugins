## Privacy Policy for Dropbox Plugin

The Dropbox plugin ("the plugin") allows users to interact with their Dropbox account within the Dify platform. This privacy policy outlines how we handle your data when you use this plugin.

### Data Collection and Usage

1. **Dropbox Access Token**: The plugin requires your Dropbox access token to authenticate and interact with your Dropbox account. This token is stored securely on Dify's servers and is only used for the purpose of fulfilling your requests through the plugin.

2. **File Access**: The plugin accesses files and folders in your Dropbox account as directed by your commands. This includes listing, searching, uploading, downloading, creating, and deleting files and folders.

3. **Content Handling**: 
   - When you upload files through the plugin, the content is transmitted directly to your Dropbox account.
   - When you download files, the content is briefly processed by the plugin to prepare it for display or transmission.
   - The plugin does not permanently store the content of your files.

### Data Sharing

The plugin does not share your data with third parties. All interactions are limited to:
- Your Dify workspace
- Your Dropbox account
- Communication between these two services

### Data Security

1. **Token Security**: Your Dropbox access token is encrypted at rest and only used when processing your specific requests.

2. **Content Security**: File content is processed in memory and is not persistently stored by the plugin beyond the duration needed to fulfill your request.

### Your Rights

You can revoke access to the plugin at any time by:
1. Removing the plugin from your Dify workspace
2. Revoking the token from your Dropbox account settings

### Changes to Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy as necessary to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons.
