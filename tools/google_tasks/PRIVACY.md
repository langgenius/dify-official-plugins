# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date: August 8, 2025**

This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use the Google Tasks Plugin for Dify.

## Information Collection

We do not collect, store, or share any personal information from users. All data processed by the plugin is handled locally or through secure connections to Google services, as required for functionality.

## Use of Information

The plugin only accesses your Google Tasks data to provide the requested features, such as:
- Listing task lists and tasks
- Creating, updating, and deleting tasks
- Retrieving task details and batch operations
- Managing task completion status and due dates

No data is stored or transmitted to third parties by the plugin itself. All operations are performed directly between your Dify instance and Google's servers.

## Data Security

We are committed to ensuring the security of your data. All communications with Google services use secure protocols (HTTPS) and OAuth 2.0 authentication. We do not retain any user credentials or task data beyond the duration of your session. Access tokens and refresh tokens are stored securely by Dify for the purpose of providing the tool functionality.

## Third-Party Services

This plugin interacts with Google Tasks via official Google APIs using the scope `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/tasks`. Please refer to Google's privacy policy for details on how your data is handled by Google services.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted in this document with an updated effective date.

## Contact

If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact the developer [hello@dify.ai](mailto:hello@dify.ai) or refer to the project repository for more information.
