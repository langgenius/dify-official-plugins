## Overview

**Podcast Generator** is a powerful tool for creating podcast audio files using Text-to-Speech (TTS) services. This tool can generate a podcast with alternating voices by providing a script, making it ideal for dialogue-based content, interviews, or storytelling.

Powered by OpenAI-based TTS services, Podcast Generator simplifies the production of high-quality audio content. Currently this tool supoorts following TTS services:

- OpenAI TTS (and other OpenAI-compatible TTS services)
- Azure OpenAI TTS

You can specify the TTS models, voices, and instructions used for each host in the podcast, allowing for a personalized touch to your audio content.

## Configuration

To start using Podcast Generator, follow these steps:

1. **Get an API Key for your TTS Service**
   Depending on the TTS service you want to use (for example, [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/)), create a new API Key, and ensure that your account is properly set up with sufficient access.
2. **Install the Podcast Generator Tool**
   Open the Plugin Marketplace, search for the Podcast Generator tool, and install it to integrate it with your application.
3. **Authorize Podcast Generator**
   Go to **Plugins > Podcast Generator > Authorize**.  
   Enter your API Key to activate the tool. Here's a minimal example of how to set up the tool:

You can authorize multiple TTS services or models by repeating the authorization process for each service or model you want to use.  
It's recommended to name each authorization entry by **Authorization Name** field, so you can easily identify which TTS service or model to use later.

**Note**: If you select **OpenAI TTS** and leave the **Model Name** field empty, it's defaulted to `tts-1`. If you select **Azure OpenAI TTS**, the **API Base URL** and **Deployment Name** fields are required.

## Tool Feature

The **Podcast Audio Generator** action converts your text script into a podcast audio file using two alternating voices.

1. **Input the Podcast Script**
   Provide a script containing alternating lines for two hosts, separated by newline characters. Each line corresponds to what one of the hosts will say.
2. **Select Host Voices**
   Choose a voice for **Host 1** and **Host 2** from the available options. These voices will be used to narrate the respective lines in the script.  
   Optionally, you can also specify the **Instructions** for each host to guide the tone or style of their narration.
3. **Select Output Format**
   By default, the output format is monaural WAV audio. You can select `mono` or `stereo` in the **Channel Mode** field, and specify `WAV` or `MP3` as the output format in the **Output Format** field.  
   If you select `stereo` mode, Host 1's voice is positioned slightly to the left, while Host 2's voice is positioned slightly to the right.
4. **Generate the Podcast Audio**
   Once the script and voices are set, run the action to create your podcast audio file. The result will combine the two voices, alternating as per the script.
