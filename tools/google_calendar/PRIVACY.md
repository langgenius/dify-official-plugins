**Effective Date: August 7, 2025**

This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use the Google Calendar Plugin for Dify.

## Third-Party Services

This plugin interacts with Google Calendar via official APIs. Please refer to Google's privacy policy for details on how your data is handled by Google services.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted in this document with an updated effective date.
