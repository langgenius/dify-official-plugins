She gives him a fax from corporate which he crumples up and tosses into the trash, calling it his special file for messages from the corporate office. He shows the camera his World\'s Best Boss mug and tells how he bought it from Spencer Gifts.\n\nJim tries to explain his job selling paper, but admits it\'s boring him even talking about it. Michael comes out of his office and shouts the years-old gag "Whassssuuupp?" to Jim and Dwight who play along.\n\nMichael\'s direct supervisor, Jan Levinson-Gould, then enters the office for a meeting with Michael. Michael admits he calls her Hillary Rodham Clinton, but not because he\'s afraid of\n---\nher. Jan asks if Michael has any questions about the agenda which he claims not to have seen and proceeds to lecture Pam who then reveals, in front of Jan, that Michael threw it away. Michael backpedals that it was just a joke.\n\nJan explains that corporate doesn\'t see the point in having both the Scranton and Stamford branches. Michael immediately assumes the worst. Jan tries to assure him that it\'s not a foregone conclusion that Scranton will be shut down. Michael wonders if Josh, the regional manager at Stamford, is worried about downsizing.\n\nThen Michael takes a call from Todd Packer, the branch\'s traveling salesman, who, not realizing he\'s on speakerphone in Jan\'s presence, calls her "Godzillary" and asks Michael if the carpet matches the drapes. Michael quickly realizes his mistake and mumbles about how inappropriate that was.\n\nJan concludes the meeting by asking Michael to keep all of this information under wraps for now.\n\nIn the break room, Oscar Martinez, Phyllis Vance, and Stanley Hudson are at a table talking about the possibility of downsizing. Oscar admits he\'s updating his resume. Angela Martin worries she\'ll be let go and Kevin Malone agrees. Jim and Pam are too busy laughing about whether or not they will attend Angela\'s cat party on Sunday.\n\nIn the midst of all this, Ryan Howard arrives from the temporary employment agency. Michael demonstrates his humor by imitating Moe, from The Three Stooges and Adolf Hitler.

Dwight, too, tells the camera he has no problem with downsizing and that he has been recommending it since he first arrived at Dunder Mifflin.\n\nPam hands Michael some of his messages. He pretends to act like the Six Million Dollar Man for several long moments. He decides that six million dollars would be a great salary for him and asks Pam's opinion. Pam mentions her salary could use a boost, too. Suddenly, Michael becomes serious, lecturing Pam she should take up her salary concerns with HR if she thinks there's a problem.\n\nThe staff is called into the conference room. Dwight, desperate to help, wants to back up Michael as Assistant Regional Manager. Michael will only acquiesce to Assistant to the Regional Manager. Michael explains that he's aware of the rumors and can confirm that Jan has indicated to him that there might be downsizing which could involve either Scranton or Stamford. Both Oscar and Stanley question Michael's assurances that he will not permit this branch to be closed. To change the subject, he tries to field a question from Pam who he claims looks like she wants to ask a question. Pam mentions that, being present in the meeting with Jan, it certainly did sound like Scranton could be shuttered. Michael, who doesn't seem to recognize that this whole meeting is breaking Jan's request for confidentiality, lectures Pam about leaking information. Out in the office, Ryan expresses his concerns by phone that he's hearing rumors the branch might be shut down.\n\nJim wonders what he will do with all this useless information he's gathered about paper. He also knows Pam's favorite yogurt flavor: mixed berry. Pam admits to the camera that he's right.\n\nMichael introduces Ryan to the office. When he gets to Dwight, he asks him to tell Ryan about his car and his martial arts. Dwight starts to grab some photos of his car when he finds that someone has encased his stapler in Jell-O. He's furious because this is the third time and insists that Michael, as a witness, should discipline Jim. Jim, eating Jell-O, wants to know why Dwight thinks it's him. He and Ryan distract Michael by making dessert puns. Michael can't think of one.\n\nJim tries to convince Pam to join the gang for some drinks after work. Her fiancé, Roy, one of the warehouse workers, arrives. Pam admits that she and Roy have been engaged for three years. They are supposed to be married in September, but she believes it'll probably not be until Spring. Roy tells her he just wants to go home. She leaves her desk to finish up some work. Jim tries to make small talk, but Roy isn't having it.\n\nJim tells the camera that he doesn't think he'll be invited to the wedding.\n---\nWhile Michael conveys his management style to Ryan (friend first, boss second), he decides to pull a prank on Pam.

Also, in that scene, Brian Baumgartner used his regular voice instead of his "Kevin" voice.[4]:38:12\n- The "cat party" scene was improvised by Jenna Fischer and John Krasinski. It was inspired by an incident that took place during one of the "work sessions": Angela Kinsey (as Angela Martin) gave Jenna Fischer (as Pam Beesly) a Post-It note inviting Pam to her cat\'s birthday party. When Ken Kwapis instructed Jenna Fischer and John Krasinski to flirt, Jenna Fischer saw the note and improvised upon it.[3]\n- Jenna Fischer couldn\'t help laughing at Steve Carell doing the "Six Million Dollar Man" joke. To get her reaction, they had to remove Carell from the set.[4]:24:20\n- Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant recommended removing the scene in which Michael fake-fires Pam, because they realized that it made the boss character too mean, and they had trouble coming back from that. Greg Daniels fought to keep it. In an alternate version, Pam replies, "You\'re a sad little man," but that was deemed too harsh.[4]:46:26\n- The two women in blue sweaters at the staff meeting were actual accountants that worked on the production. Greg Daniels decided not to use them regularly because their job involved a lot of telephone calls, the sound of which would disrupt filming.\n- Henriette Mantel (credited) is one of the unidentified office workers in the conference room scene; she is seated beside Dwight. She was originally to play Meredith, but the part was recast because she was unavailable when the show was picked up.[4]:11:00 Henriette has appeared in numerous sitcoms and notably played the role of Alice in the Brady Bunch movies from the 1990s. Henriette is an actress, not an "actual accountant".\n- David Koechner had yet to be cast as Todd Packer. The voice of Todd Packer in this episode is provided by voice actor Toby Huss, a friend of Greg Daniels.[4]:19:49', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=1960, text_template='{metadata_str}\n\n{content}', class_name='TextNode'), score=0.97339284, class_name='TextNodeWithScore'), TextNodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id='dd0b5d74-139f-4ee9-97e8-ebb339c6466c', embedding=None, extra_info={'file_size': 248741, 'last_modified_at': '2025-03-12T14:42:50', 'file_path': 'The Office S01 E01 Pilot.pdf', 'file_name': 'The Office S01 E01 Pilot.pdf', 'external_file_id': 'The Office S01 E01 Pilot.pdf', 'file_id': '0983fefd-6084-4c66-956d-c2960a8f7409', 'pipeline_file_id': '9070c8c8-28d4-4e7c-b5b6-8224ace88bc8', 'pipeline_id': '611a4a09-37f5-4c98-8be9-4b67806330f9', 'header_path': '/', 'start_page_index': 4, 'start_page_label': 5, 'page_label': 5, 'end_page_index': 4, 'end_page_label': 5, 'document_id': '3bae90d80afa1983dae1d9a34035bf2b87636b922823d3aef3', 'start_char_idx': 16711, 'end_char_idx': 17070}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_id', 'pipeline_file_id', 'file_size', 'last_modified_at', 'file_id', 'pipeline_file_id', 'file_size', 'last_modified_at', 'start_page_index', 'start_page_label', 'page_label', 'end_page_index', 'end_page_label', 'document_id', 'file_id', 'pipeline_file_id'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_id', 'pipeline_file_id', 'file_size', 'last_modified_at', 'file_id', 'pipeline_file_id', 'file_size', 'last_modified_at', 'start_page_index', 'start_page_label', 'page_label', 'end_page_index', 'end_page_label', 'document_id', 'file_id', 'pipeline_file_id'], relationships={'1': RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='3bae90d80afa1983dae1d9a34035bf2b87636b922823d3aef3', node_type='4', metadata={'file_size': 248741, 'last_modified_at': '2025-03-12T14:42:50', 'file_path': 'The Office S01 E01 Pilot.pdf', 'file_name': 'The Office S01 E01 Pilot.pdf', 'external_file_id': 'The Office S01 E01 Pilot.pdf', 'file_id': '0983fefd-6084-4c66-956d-c2960a8f7409', 'pipeline_file_id': '9070c8c8-28d4-4e7c-b5b6-8224ace88bc8', 'pipeline_id': '611a4a09-37f5-4c98-8be9-4b67806330f9'}, hash='23352b7f6fcd594d35c669567412bda3d1665e048417e5ad109aa14bd79b5068', class_name='RelatedNodeInfo'), '2': RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='2d6618ef-d7e5-49db-96d9-a2d9a6ac0b6e', node_type='1', metadata={'file_size': 248741, 'last_modified_at': '2025-03-12T14:42:50', 'file_path': 'The Office S01 E01 Pilot.pdf', 'file_name': 'The Office S01 E01 Pilot.pdf', 'external_file_id': 'The Office S01 E01 Pilot.pdf', 'file_id': '0983fefd-6084-4c66-956d-c2960a8f7409', 'pipeline_file_id': '9070c8c8-28d4-4e7c-b5b6-8224ace88bc8', 'pipeline_id': '611a4a09-37f5-4c98-8be9-4b67806330f9', 'header_path': '/'}, hash='67fe1f28a1e2342815dcbc6316e264e23922e02c942ae04307d8768aeb61aa14', class_name='RelatedNodeInfo')}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\n', text='# Goofs\n\n- Boxes from an original take of the "pencil-fence scene" are visible when Michael announces the meeting.
