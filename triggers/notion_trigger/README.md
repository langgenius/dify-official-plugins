# Notion Trigger Plugin

Dify trigger plugin that receives Notion webhook events for pages, databases, data sources, and comments. It converts Notion event payloads into Dify trigger variables so workflows can react to workspace activity in near real time.

## Features

- Complete coverage of every Notion webhook event documented in `notion.md`, including the new `data_source.*` family.
- Optional signature verification using the Notion `verification_token` stored in the trigger subscription.
- Event filtering per subscription so you can subscribe broadly in Notion but forward a curated subset into Dify.
- Simple workspace filtering parameter on every event to scope automations by workspace ID.
- JSON payloads are exposed as-is, enabling downstream steps to call back into the Notion API with the received entity identifiers.

## Prerequisites

- A Notion integration with Webhook capability enabled.
- The public HTTPS endpoint generated by Dify after installing this plugin.
- Python 3.12 runtime (handled automatically when the trigger runs inside Dify).
- Local development uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage dependencies.

Install dependencies locally:

```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configure the Webhook Subscription

1. In Notion, open the integration settings → Webhooks → Create a subscription.
2. Paste the trigger endpoint provided by Dify as the webhook URL.
3. Select the event types you want Notion to emit. (You can change this list later.)
4. Submit the form. Notion immediately POSTs a JSON payload containing only `{"verification_token": "..."}`.
5. In Dify, create a new trigger connection for this plugin and paste the `verification_token` value into the Verification Token field. Optionally select the same event types in the Event Filters checkbox list to forward only a subset to the workflow.
6. Return to Notion and click Verify. Once verification succeeds, Notion will start delivering full webhook events to Dify.

### Signature Validation

When a verification token is supplied, the trigger validates every incoming request using the `X-Notion-Signature` header. The signature is an HMAC-SHA256 digest of the raw body with your verification token as the shared secret. If you skip the token, requests are still accepted, but signature checks are bypassed.

### Workspace Filtering

Every event definition includes an optional `workspace_filter` parameter. Provide a comma-separated list of workspace IDs to restrict the trigger to those workspaces only. Leave the field empty to accept events from any workspace tied to the subscription.

## Supported Events

### Page
- `page.created`
- `page.deleted`
- `page.undeleted`
- `page.content_updated`
- `page.moved`
- `page.properties_updated`
- `page.locked`
- `page.unlocked`

### Database
- `database.created`
- `database.content_updated`
- `database.deleted`
- `database.undeleted`
- `database.moved`
- `database.schema_updated`

### Data Source (API version 2025-09-03)
- `data_source.created`
- `data_source.deleted`
- `data_source.undeleted`
- `data_source.moved`
- `data_source.content_updated`
- `data_source.schema_updated`

### Comment
- `comment.created`
- `comment.updated`
- `comment.deleted`

## Testing

```bash
uv run python -m pytest -v
```

Tests rely on fixture payloads extracted from `notion.md` so they run offline and verify:

- Signature validation for trusted and untrusted requests.
- Event dispatch filtering by event type and workspace.
- Each event class forwarding the payload unchanged when the type matches.

## Packaging

To bundle the plugin for distribution:

```bash
/Applications/Development/difyplugin/dify-plugin-darwin-arm64-new plugin package notion_trigger -o notion_trigger.difypkg
```
