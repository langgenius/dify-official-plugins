# Overview
Replicate is a cloud-based platform designed to simplify the deployment and scaling of machine learning models. It provides users with access to a vast library of open-source AI models, enabling developers to run and fine-tune these models with minimal coding effort. The platform aims to democratize machine learning by making it accessible to a broader audience, including software engineers, data scientists, and product managers.

Dify supports accessing [Language models](https://replicate.com/collections/language-models) and [Embedding models](https://replicate.com/collections/embedding-models) on Replicate. Language models correspond to Dify's reasoning model, and Embedding models correspond to Dify's Embedding model.
