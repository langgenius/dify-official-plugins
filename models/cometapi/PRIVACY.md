# Privacy Policy

üõ°Ô∏è **CometAPI Privacy and Data Protection Policy**

CometAPI takes user privacy and data protection very seriously. This policy details how we collect, use, store, and protect your personal information.

## 1. üí¨ AI Model API Interaction Data Protection

We are committed to protecting your data privacy, especially during your interactions with AI models. To ensure this, we:

- **Do not collect user communications with AI models**: We never collect, store, or record any conversation content between you and the AI models, nor will we in the future.

- **Do not save user communications with AI models**: Your communication content is not saved to our servers or databases, ensuring your conversations remain completely private and secure. Additionally, storing hundreds of millions of daily requests would be prohibitively expensive and unsustainable for us.

Through these measures, we ensure that when using our website, you can enjoy a safe and private interactive environment.
