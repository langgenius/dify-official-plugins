# DeerAPI Privacy and Data Protection Policy 🛡️

DeerAPI highly values user privacy and data protection. This policy details how we collect, use, store, and protect your personal information. 🔒

## 1. Large Model API Interaction Data Protection 🤖

We are committed to protecting your data privacy, especially during your interactions with AI large models. We ensure:

**We do not collect user-AI model communication content:** 🚫
We will never collect, store, or record any conversation content between you and AI models, now or in the future.

**We do not save user-AI model communication content:** 💾
Your communication content will not be saved to our servers or databases, ensuring your conversations remain completely private and secure. Additionally, with hundreds of millions of daily requests, storing all conversations would be prohibitively expensive for us.

Through these measures, we ensure you can enjoy a safe and private interactive environment when using our website. ✨
