## Setup

### Prerequisites

Before using this plugin, you need:
1. A Tencent Cloud account with active COS service
2. COS buckets with the files you want to access
3. Tencent Cloud CAM credentials with appropriate permissions

### Configuration Steps

1. **Create Tencent Cloud CAM User** (if not already exists):
   - Sign in to the [Tencent Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/)
   - Navigate to CAM (Cloud Access Management)
   - Click "Users" â†’ "Create User"
   - Provide a user name (e.g., "dify-cos-plugin")
   - Select "Programmatic access" for Access type

2. **Set Permissions**:
   - [Attach policies that grant COS access](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/598/11084):
     - `QcloudCOSReadOnlyAccess` (for read-only access to all buckets)
     - Or create a custom policy with specific bucket permissions:
       ```json
            {
               "version": "2.0",
               "statement":[
                  {
                        "effect": "allow",
                        "action":  [
                                 "cos:List*",
                                 "cos:Get*",
                                 "cos:Head*",
                                 "cos:OptionsObject"
                              ],
                        "resource": "*"
                  }
               ]
            }
       ```

3. **Generate Access Keys**:
   - After creating the user, go to the "API Keys" tab
   - Click "Create Key"
   - Save the **SecretId** and **SecretKey** securely

4. **Configure the Plugin in Dify**:
   - **Secret ID**: Enter the SecretId from your Tencent Cloud CAM user
   - **Secret Key**: Enter the SecretKey from your Tencent Cloud CAM user
   - **Region**: Enter your COS region (e.g., `ap-beijing`, `ap-shanghai`, `ap-guangzhou`)
   - Click "Save" to store the credentials

## Usage

### Browsing Files

The plugin provides an online drive interface for browsing COS content:

1. **List Buckets**: When no bucket is specified, the plugin lists all available COS buckets
2. **Browse Bucket Contents**: Select a bucket to view its files and folders
3. **Navigate Folders**: Click on folders to browse their contents
4. **Pagination**: Use pagination controls for buckets with many files

### Downloading Files

To download a file:
1. Browse to the desired file
2. Select the file for download
3. The plugin retrieves the file content and metadata

## Supported Operations

| Operation | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| List Buckets | View all COS buckets in your Tencent Cloud account |
| Browse Files | Navigate through files and folders in a bucket |
| Download File | Retrieve file content from COS |
| Pagination | Handle large file lists with continuation tokens |

## Security Considerations

- **Credentials**: Store your Tencent Cloud credentials securely and never share them
- **Permissions**: Use the principle of least privilege - grant only necessary COS permissions
- **Region**: Ensure you're using the correct Tencent Cloud region for your buckets
- **Encryption**: Consider using COS server-side encryption for sensitive data

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Credentials not found" error**:
   - Verify that SecretId and SecretKey are correctly configured
   - Check that the CAM user is active

2. **"Access Denied" error**:
   - Ensure the CAM user has proper COS permissions
   - Verify the bucket policy allows access from your CAM user

3. **"Bucket not found" error**:
   - Check that the bucket name is correct
   - Ensure the bucket exists in the specified region

4. **Region connectivity issues**:
   - Verify the region name is correct (e.g., `ap-beijing`)
   - Ensure the bucket exists in the specified region

## Tencent Cloud Regions

Common Tencent Cloud regions include:
- `ap-beijing` (Beijing)
- `ap-shanghai` (Shanghai)
- `ap-guangzhou` (Guangzhou)
- `ap-chengdu` (Chengdu)
