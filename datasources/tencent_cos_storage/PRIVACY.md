# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use the Tencent COS Storage Datasource Plugin for Dify.

## Information Collection

We do not collect, store, or share any personal information from users. All data processed by the plugin is handled locally or through secure connections to Tencent Cloud COS, as required for functionality.

## Use of Information

The plugin only accesses your Tencent Cloud COS buckets and objects to provide the requested features, such as browsing and downloading files from your COS storage. No data is stored or transmitted to third parties by the plugin itself.

## Data Security

We are committed to ensuring the security of your data. All communications with Tencent Cloud COS services use secure protocols (HTTPS) and Tencent Cloud's secure authentication mechanisms. We do not retain any user credentials or file data beyond the duration of your session.

## Third-Party Services

This plugin interacts with Tencent Cloud COS via the official COS Python SDK (cos-python-sdk-v5). Please refer to Tencent Cloud's privacy policy for details on how your data is handled by Tencent Cloud services.

## Data Access Scope

The plugin requires the following permissions to function:
- COS bucket listing permissions
- COS object listing permissions within specified buckets
- COS object download permissions for specified files

These permissions are used solely for the intended functionality and no additional data is accessed.

## Credential Security

Your Tencent Cloud credentials (SecretId, SecretKey, and Region) are used only to authenticate with Tencent Cloud COS services. These credentials are:
- Never stored permanently by the plugin
- Only used during active sessions
- Transmitted securely using encrypted connections
- Never shared with any third parties

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted in this document with an updated effective date.

## Contact

If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact the developer [hello@dify.ai](mailto:hello@dify.ai) or refer to the project repository for more information.
