- **OAuth 2.0 Authentication**: Secure authentication using Google's OAuth 2.0 flow

## Setup

### Prerequisites

Before using this plugin, you need:
1. A Google account with Google Drive enabled
2. Access to Google Cloud Console to create OAuth 2.0 credentials
3. Files in your Google Drive that you want to access

### Configuration Steps

1. **Create a Google Cloud Project**:
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Click "Create Project" or select an existing project
   - Give your project a name (e.g., "Dify Google Drive Plugin")

2. **Enable Google Drive API**:
   - In your Google Cloud project, go to "APIs & Services" → "Library"
   - Search for "Google Drive API"
   - Click on it and press "Enable"

3. **Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials**:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" → "Credentials"
   - Click "Create Credentials" → "OAuth client ID"
   - If prompted, configure the OAuth consent screen first:
     - **User Type**: Choose based on your needs (Internal for organization use, External for general use)
     - **App name**: Dify Google Drive Plugin
     - **User support email**: Your email address
     - **Developer contact information**: Your email address
   - For the OAuth client ID:
     - **Application type**: Web application
     - **Name**: Dify Google Drive Plugin
     - **Authorized redirect URIs**: 
       - For SaaS (cloud.dify.ai) users: `https://cloud.dify.ai/console/api/oauth/plugin/langgenius/google_drive/google_drive/datasource/callback`
       - For self-hosted users: `http://<YOUR CONSOLE_API_URL>/console/api/oauth/plugin/langgenius/google_drive/google_drive/datasource/callback`
       - Replace `<YOUR CONSOLE_API_URL>` with your actual console API URL

4. **Configure OAuth Consent Screen**:
   - Add the following OAuth scopes:
     - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly` - View and download all files
     - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.metadata.readonly` - View metadata for files
   - Add test users if your app is in testing mode

5. **Get Your Credentials**:
   - After creating the OAuth client, copy:
     - **Client ID**
     - **Client Secret**
   - Keep these secure as they will be needed in Dify

6. **Configure the Plugin in Dify**:
   - Navigate to the datasource plugins section in Dify
   - Select Google Drive
   - Enter your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
   - Click "Save and authorize"
   - You'll be redirected to Google's OAuth consent page
   - Grant the necessary permissions
   - You'll be redirected back to Dify upon successful authorization

## Usage

### Browsing Files

The plugin provides an interface for browsing Google Drive content:

1. **Root Directory**: Start by browsing from the root of your Google Drive
2. **Folder Navigation**: Click on folders to browse their contents
3. **File Information**: View file names, sizes, and types
4. **Pagination**: Navigate through pages when you have many files

### Downloading Files

To download a file:
1. Browse to locate the desired file
2. Select the file for download
3. The plugin retrieves the file content and metadata

### Google Workspace Files

The plugin automatically handles Google Workspace files:
- **Google Docs**: Exported as PDF
- **Google Sheets**: Exported as Excel (XLSX)
- **Google Slides**: Exported as PDF
- **Google Drawings**: Exported as PNG
- **Google Forms**: Exported as PDF

## Supported Operations

| Operation | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| List Files | Browse files and folders in Google Drive |
| Navigate Folders | Access files within specific folders |
| Download File | Retrieve file content from Google Drive |
| Export Workspace Files | Automatic conversion of Google Workspace files |
| Pagination | Handle large file lists with page tokens |

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Authentication failed (401 Unauthorized)" error**:
   - The access token has expired
   - Solution: Reauthorize the connection in Dify settings

2. **"File not found" error**:
   - The file may have been deleted or moved
   - You may not have permission to access the file
   - Solution: Verify the file exists and you have access

3. **"Failed to list files" error**:
   - Check your internet connection
   - Verify API quotas haven't been exceeded
   - Ensure Google Drive API is enabled in your project

4. **OAuth Authorization Issues**:
   - Verify redirect URI matches exactly (including protocol and trailing slashes)
   - Check that all required scopes are configured
   - Ensure client ID and secret are correct

5. **Files Not Showing**:
   - Check if files are in trash (trashed files are not shown)
   - Verify you have permission to view the files
   - Ensure the parent folder ID is correct when browsing subfolders

## API Quotas and Limits

Google Drive API has usage quotas:
- **Queries per day**: 1,000,000,000
- **Queries per 100 seconds per user**: 1,000
- **Queries per 100 seconds**: 10,000

If you encounter quota errors, wait before retrying or request a quota increase in Google Cloud Console.

## Security Considerations

- **OAuth 2.0**: Uses secure OAuth 2.0 flow for authentication
- **Token Storage**: Access and refresh tokens are stored securely
- **Minimal Permissions**: Only requests read-only access to files
- **HTTPS**: All API communications use encrypted HTTPS connections
- **Token Refresh**: Automatically refreshes expired tokens when possible
