# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use the SharePoint Datasource Plugin for Dify.

## Information Collection

We do not collect, store, or share any personal information from users. All data processed by the plugin is handled locally or through secure connections to Microsoft SharePoint services, as required for functionality.

## Use of Information

The plugin only accesses your SharePoint data to provide the requested features, such as retrieving files and documents from your SharePoint sites. No data is stored or transmitted to third parties by the plugin itself.

## Data Security

We are committed to ensuring the security of your data. All communications with Microsoft SharePoint services use secure protocols (such as HTTPS). We do not retain any user credentials or file data beyond the duration of your session.

## Third-Party Services

This plugin interacts with Microsoft SharePoint via official Microsoft Graph APIs. Please refer to Microsoft's privacy policy for details on how your data is handled by Microsoft services.

## Data Access Scope

The plugin requires the following permissions to function:
- `User.Read`: To access basic user information
- `Sites.Read.All`: To access SharePoint sites
- `Files.Read.All`: To read files from SharePoint document libraries
- `Group.Read.All`: To access group information

These permissions are used solely for the intended functionality and no additional data is accessed.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted in this document with an updated effective date.

## Contact

If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact the developer [hello@dify.ai](mailto:hello@dify.ai) or refer to the project repository for more information.
