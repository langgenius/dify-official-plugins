# GitLab Datasource Plugin - Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** January 2025  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Plugin Version:** 0.3.0

## Overview

This privacy policy describes how the GitLab Datasource Plugin for Dify ("the Plugin") collects, uses, and protects your information when accessing GitLab projects, issues, merge requests, and files. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparent data handling practices.

## üìä Data Collection and Usage

### What Data We Access

The Plugin accesses only the GitLab data you explicitly authorize:

#### **Project Data**
- Project metadata (name, description, visibility, creation date)
- Repository structure and file listings
- File contents (code, documentation, configuration files)
- Branch and tag information
- Project settings and permissions

#### **Issue Data**
- Issue titles, descriptions, and metadata
- Issue comments and discussion threads
- Labels, assignees, and status information
- Creation and modification timestamps

#### **Merge Request Data**
- MR titles, descriptions, and metadata
- Discussion threads and review comments
- Code changes and diffs (when requested)
- Approval status and pipeline information

#### **User Data**
- GitLab username and display name
- User avatar URLs (for attribution)
- Email addresses (only if publicly available)
- User activity related to accessed content

### How We Use Your Data

Your GitLab data is used exclusively for:

1. **Knowledge Base Construction**: Processing and indexing content for Dify's AI capabilities
2. **Content Retrieval**: Providing access to your GitLab content within Dify workflows
3. **Metadata Enhancement**: Enriching content with context and relationships
4. **Search and Discovery**: Enabling intelligent search across your GitLab content

### What We Do NOT Do

- ‚ùå Store your GitLab credentials permanently
- ‚ùå Access content outside your explicit authorization
- ‚ùå Share your data with unauthorized third parties
- ‚ùå Use your data for advertising or marketing
- ‚ùå Perform analytics on your private content
- ‚ùå Modify or delete your GitLab content

## üîê Authentication and Credential Security

### Personal Access Tokens (PAT)

**Storage**: Personal Access Tokens are encrypted and stored securely within the Dify platform using industry-standard encryption methods.

**Transmission**: All token transmission occurs over HTTPS/TLS encrypted connections.

**Scope Limitation**: We recommend using tokens with minimal required scopes:
- `read_user`: User profile access
- `read_repository`: Project file access  
- `api`: Issues and merge request access

**Token Rotation**: We recommend rotating tokens every 90 days for enhanced security.

### OAuth 2.0 Authentication

**Authorization Flow**: Follows GitLab's standard OAuth 2.0 flow with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) when supported.

**Token Storage**: Access tokens are encrypted and stored securely. Refresh tokens are used to maintain authentication without requiring re-authorization.

**Scope Management**: OAuth applications request only the minimum necessary scopes for functionality.

## üåê GitLab Instance Types

### GitLab.com (Cloud)

When using GitLab.com:
- Data transmission follows GitLab's cloud infrastructure security
- Subject to GitLab's privacy policy and terms of service
